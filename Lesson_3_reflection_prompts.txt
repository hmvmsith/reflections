When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository if I wanted to share my files and work collaboratively.  
    I'd also use a remote repository to have a backup copy of my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   forks are clones within GitHub.  Clones are created from another repository to a local repository.  And branches are within a reository 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  Allows you to work offline with the most current changes.  When you are able to be back online you can merge your updates with any updates performed by others. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  I'm not a developerso I don't have a lot of experience with this.  Without GitHub you would need to work a lot closer, and check with others before making any changes.  More than one person would not be able to work simultaneously. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If I wanted to create a new project starting with a base from master.  Also, if I were working on updates or enhancements to a separate part of the initial project.
